# DS 350 Fall '23 - CAPS Lab

#### Motivation
The Black Lives Matter movement began with a social media hashtag, #BlackLivesMatter, after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in 2012. Most recently, #BlackLivesMatter has spearheaded demonstrations worldwide protesting police brutality and systematic racism. As an independent study with the CAPS Lab (Computational Analysis for Political Science), I set out to investigate trends in hashtag usage related to the BLM movement and how these trends could be visualized using Python Dash.
